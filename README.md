Random C# Programs

Welcome to my GitHub repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository is a collection of random C# programs that I am working on as I learn the language. Each file or project here represents different exercises, concepts, or small projects that I'm experimenting with while getting more familiar with C#.

About
Learning C#: This is a personal learning repository where I explore various C# features, syntax, and libraries.
Random Programs: You'll find a wide variety of programs here â€” from simple console apps to more complex algorithms and challenges.
No Guarantees: Since I am still learning, these programs might not be the most efficient or well-structured, but they serve as a valuable learning experience for me.
What You'll Find Here
Console-based applications: Many of the programs are designed to run in the terminal or console.
Learning Projects: Small programs focused on specific C# concepts such as loops, classes, LINQ, etc.
Code snippets: Random bits of code or small challenges I work through to better understand C#.
Getting Started
If you're interested in trying out any of the programs, just download the files (https://github.com/Wheelie243/Learning/releases/tag/funny)
